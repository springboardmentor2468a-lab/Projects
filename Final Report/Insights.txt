-------------------------------Key Insights-------------------------------
On average, children are spending nearly 4 hours a day on screens. A vast majority of them are exceeding the medically recommended limits for their age group.

The smartphone is the go-to device for most children, far surpassing TVs, laptops, and tablets. This makes screen time highly portable and accessible at all times.

The most commonly reported health issue linked to screen time is poor sleep. This is followed by other physical ailments like eye strain and mental health concerns like anxiety.

The pre-teen age group (11-14) shows the highest average daily screen time. Their usage is driven primarily by portable devices like smartphones and laptops.

The content children consume is heavily skewed towards recreational activities rather than educational ones. The data shows that more screen time does not necessarily mean more time spent learning.

While screen time is prevalent everywhere, urban children are more likely to report a combination of both physical (e.g., poor sleep) and mental (e.g., anxiety) health impacts.
