📊 Final Insights – Indian Kids Screen Time Dashboard
🧒 1. Overview

The dashboard analyzes how much time Indian children spend on digital devices daily.

It highlights usage trends, device preferences, health impacts, and parental influence.

💻 2. Device Usage

Mobile phones are the most used devices by children.

Tablets and laptops are mainly used for online learning.

TV usage has decreased compared to mobile and tablet usage.

Children prefer smart devices for both education and entertainment.

⏰ 3. Average Screen Time

The average daily screen time is around 3–5 hours.

Screen time increases on weekends compared to weekdays.

Teenagers spend more time on screens than younger children.

🎮 4. Purpose of Screen Usage

Entertainment (YouTube, games, OTT) takes up the largest portion.

Education-related activities come second, mainly during school hours.

Social media usage starts at a young age and increases with age.

Children often multitask — watching videos while doing homework.

⚕️ 5. Health and Lifestyle Impact

High screen exposure leads to eye strain, sleep issues, and less physical activity.

Excessive use causes concentration problems in academics.

Balanced use promotes better mood and performance.

More screen time → less outdoor play and reduced social interaction.

👨‍👩‍👧 6. Parental Monitoring

Parents who set screen limits report healthier digital behavior in kids.

Unmonitored screen use leads to late-night gadget usage.

Parental involvement improves content quality and time control.

📈 7. Key Trends & Correlations

Older children → longer daily screen hours.

Urban kids → higher device use due to digital access.

Less outdoor activity → more screen dependency.

Moderate use correlates with better mental health outcomes.

🧠 8. Conclusion & Recommendations

Promote digital balance — limit screen time to 2–3 hours per day.

Encourage learning-based and creative apps over entertainment.

Schools and parents should work together on digital awareness.

Regular breaks from screens and outdoor play are essential for a healthy lifestyle.
 Observations from the Project

While analyzing the dataset, it was observed that screen time varies significantly by age group, with a sharp rise during teenage years (13–17 years).

Boys tend to spend slightly more time on gaming and video content compared to girls, who use devices more for educational and social activities.

During exam seasons or school holidays, screen time fluctuates — higher during vacations and lower during exams.

A noticeable pattern was seen where children using devices for learning purposes had more balanced screen habits compared to those using them mainly for entertainment.

In many cases, urban children have more access to multiple devices, while rural children mostly use shared family devices.

There’s a visible connection between parental education level and screen regulation — educated parents tend to enforce better digital discipline.

Some children use multiple devices simultaneously (e.g., watching videos on mobile while using a tablet), leading to higher cumulative screen time.

Data shows that even small increases in daily screen hours impact sleep quality and outdoor activity noticeably.

Creating the dashboard helped identify how data visualization makes behavioral patterns easier to interpret than raw data.

Building this project improved my understanding of data cleaning, visualization techniques, and storytelling through Power BI dashboards.
