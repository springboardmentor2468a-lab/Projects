# DV ScreenSense: Indian Kids Screentime Analysis 2025

---

## Overview
DV ScreenSense analyzes Indian kidsâ€™ screen time patterns to uncover trends by age, gender, location type (urban/rural), device type, dayâ€‘ofâ€‘week, and activity category. The goal is to present clear, actionable insights for parents, educators, and policymakers through data analysis and visualization.

---

## Objectives
- Preprocess and clean the dataset for reliable analysis  
- Explore weekday vs weekend usage patterns  
- Identify device and activity preferences across demographics  
- Visualize key metrics using bar charts, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and comparisons  
- Build dashboards and reports for nonâ€‘technical stakeholders  
- Deliver a final presentation with insights and visuals
