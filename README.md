OVERVIEW:

DV ScreenSense analyzes Indian kids’ screen time patterns to uncover trends by age, gender, location type (urban/rural), device type, day‑of‑week, and activity category. The goal is to present clear, actionable insights for parents, educators, and policymakers through data analysis and visualization.

OBJECTIVES:

Preprocess and clean the dataset for reliable analysis
Explore weekday vs weekend usage patterns
Identify device and activity preferences across demographics
Visualize key metrics using bar charts, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and comparisons
Build dashboards and reports for non‑technical stakeholders
Deliver a final presentation with insights and visuals
