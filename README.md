📊 Indian Kids Screen Time Analysis

📁 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes screen time habits among Indian children, focusing on device usage patterns, time spent, and health impacts. The dashboard provides insights into how different factors — such as device category, age group, and location type (urban/rural) — influence screen time behavior and well-being.

🎯 Objective

To visualize and understand the relationship between screen time and its effects on health, helping parents, educators, and policymakers make informed decisions.

📈 Key Insights

Device Category vs Health Impact: Compares how various devices (Mobile, TV, Tablet, Laptop) affect health differently.

Screen Time Duration Analysis: Identifies children exceeding recommended screen time limits.

Educational vs Recreational Usage: Shows the ratio of learning vs entertainment-related usage.

Urban vs Rural Comparison: Highlights differences in screen habits across regions.

Correlation Matrix: Displays relationships between variables such as age, screen time, and health score.
